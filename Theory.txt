Theory

All plastics are a dielectric. 
Given a strong enough electric field they will be attracted or repelled.
Examing a materials relative permativity we can evaluate it's polarizability.

Example:
Nylon


Once near the electric field deformation of the atom occurs and micro-electric fields begin to form creating the
static-electric attraction.
