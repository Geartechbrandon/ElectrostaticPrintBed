# ElectrostaticPrintBed

Research into direct printing onto a charged surface with FDM/FFF 3D printer.


Goals:

----Improve range and reduce nozzle distance from 10mm to 0.2mm
----Determine bonding strength with electric fied on

Expected potential issues:
----XY bonding is weak, might need to knurl or customize printing surface
----Electric field is too small to make large objects
----Heated surface might still be needed.
