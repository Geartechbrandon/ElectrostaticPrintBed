# ElectrostaticPrintBed

Research into direct printing onto a charged surface with FDM/FFF 3D printer.

<<<<<<< HEAD

Goals:

----Improve range and reduce nozzle distance from 10mm to 0.2mm
----Determine bonding strength with electric fied on

Expected potential issues:
----XY bonding is weak, might need to knurl or customize printing surface
----Electric field is too small to make large objects
----Heated surface might still be needed.
=======
The files are built in LaTeX and will require a compiler, such as MikTeX for Windows, to run. For convenience the milestones will be built into PDFs.
